#### 7R of cloud migration 
1. **Refactor/Re-architect**. Transform an application by altering its architecture and leveraging cloud-native features to enhance agility, performance, and scalability. This usually involves porting the operating system and database.
2. **Replatform (Lift and Reshape)**. Transfer an application to the cloud, incorporating some optimization to benefit from cloud capabilities.
3. **Repurchase (Drop and Shop)**. Transition to another product, often by adopting a SaaS model instead of a traditional licensing approach.
4. **Rehost (Lift and Shift)**. Migrate an application to the cloud without implementing changes to utilize cloud features.
5. **Relocate (Hypervisor-Level Lift and Shift)**. Shift infrastructure to the cloud without the need for new hardware, application rewrites, or adjustments to current operations. Technologies like VMware Cloud enable this migration approach.
6. **Retain (Revisit)**. Maintain applications in their original environment. This can include applications that need significant refactoring, which can be deferred to a future time, or legacy applications that remain in place due to a lack of business justification for migration.
7. **Retire**. Discontinue or eliminate applications that are no longer required in the source environment.
