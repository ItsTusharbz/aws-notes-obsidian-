- Ability of system to withstand system failure or disaster, manage dynamic load or network issue, basically the system should recover from any scenario.
- Design principle
  - Test recovery procedures - use automation to simulate different failures
  - Automatically recover from failure - Anticipate failure before happen
  - Scale horizontally to aggregate system availability - Distribute request to multiple endpoint to not have single point of failure
  - Stop guessing capacity - use auto scaling as much as possible
  - Use automation to mange changes in system as much as possible
